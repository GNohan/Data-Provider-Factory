# Data-Provider-Factory
A simple example of a database connection using a Data Provider Factory.

# Functionality
*Will not work for other users without tweaking*
This originally connected to a database on my schools server and accessed an inventory table that
held information about car makes and models. The App Config held all of the connection
security data. It will have to be updated to connect to a DB of your choice. All in all this is just a simple
example and maybe a good reference point for creating your own.
